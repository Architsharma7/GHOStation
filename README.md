# GHOSTATION

The all-in-one insurance, yield generation and analytics platform for GHO ecosystem protocols.

GHOSTATION allows protocols in the GHO ecosystem to purchase insurance policies that pay out in case of hacks/vulnerabilities. It also offers yield opportunities for regular users via vaults that provide interest by leveraging DEX liquidity pools.

## Core Features:
Protocol Insurance - Protocols within the GHO ecosystem can buy insurance and pay premiums to acquire insurance coverage to take out policies that provide a payout in case of disaster events to secure coverage. Protocols stake the premium monthly in the insurance vaults where users also stake, in case of any event, the TVL can be used to payout the insurance to the protocol. The users are also incentivized to stake in the vault by giving high-yield amounts and trust in the protocols. ** This creates a better GHO ecosystem where protocols would also want to participate ** ** It also ensures the price of GHO does not de-peg in case of any attack on a protocol using GHO. **

- User Yield Vaults - Users can deposit GHO tokens into vaults that distribute funds across different yield-generating protocols like Uniswap, Curve and Balancer liquidity pools in certain percentages based on their APYs to generate yield for the user. Users enjoy maximum yield compared to depositing on different protocols without any hassle.

- GHO Analytics - GHOStation provides analytics for all your GHO interactions and Transactions along with a graphical experience for your analytics. Charts and graphs provide real-time and historical visual data on GHO token metrics.

- Claims Verification - GHOStation allows stakers other than users to verify and validate or dispute insurance claims made by registered protocols. Stakers get a prize amount on every decision they make.

## Protocol Integrations
**GHO**
The GHO token powers all operations and transactions within the GHO Hub ecosystem. Protocols leverage GHO to purchase coverage policies and pay premiums to protect themselves against potential threats or losses. Regular users can deposit their GHO tokens into a variety of yield-generating vaults to passively grow their holdings over time. Users also utilize GHO to place stake deposits in order to verify and validate insurance claims made by protocols seeking payouts. For making payments across the platform as well as transferring value in or out, the GHO token is the predominant medium of exchange. Whether as a means of payment, yield generation, staking, policy fuels, or trading, the GHO token is deeply integrated across all aspects of the GHOSTATION platform.

**Family KIT**
The platform enables seamless connectivity to leading browser-based crypto wallets such as MetaMask for users through integration with family-kit's ConnectKit.
